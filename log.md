# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 30, 2018
##### The Journey Begins, Sort Of

**Today's Progress**: Trying to figure out GitHub and how all of this works.

**Thoughts:** Set up freeCodeCamp account and plan to start there for this particular edition of 100 days of code. Still getting used to GitHub. Have not attempted to do much with the command line; it terrifies me a little, like staring into a oblivion, which is where I assume my first attempts at anything will go. But hey, this is all day zero stuff so I still have time. :)

**Link to work:** You're literally looking at the work in front of you.  I figured out how to edit a document on GitHub!

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
