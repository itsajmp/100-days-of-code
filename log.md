# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sunday, December 30, 2018
##### The Journey Begins, Sort Of

**Today's Progress**: Trying to figure out GitHub and how all of this works.

**Thoughts:** Set up freeCodeCamp account and plan to start there for this particular edition of 100 days of code. Still getting used to GitHub. Have not attempted to do much with the command line; it terrifies me a little, like staring into a oblivion, which is where I assume my first attempts at anything will go. But hey, this is all day zero stuff so I still have time. :)

**Link to work:** You're literally looking at the work in front of you.  I figured out how to edit a document on GitHub!

##### Baby Steps

**Today's Progress**: Set up Visual Studio Code

**Thoughts**: Decided to use VSCode as my text editor in addition to freeCodeCamp as my primary learning resource. Watched YouTube videos on how other developers set up their environment.  I plan to use VSCode for additional local environment work in addition to FCC as I think it will help the material sink in better. Also, I didn't start today because of that ridiculous but very real desire to be a better person in the new year. Clearly I cannot start until tomorrow. Obviously.

**Link(s) to work**: Still nothing to show! Aren't zero days the best? You get to do nothing but claim you made real progress. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


### Day 1: Tuesday, January 1, 2019
#### Happy New Year!

**Today's Progress**: Literally square one.  

**Thoughts** Today I began my be-a-better-person-in-the-new-year thing by deciding to dive in head first to coding.  Why?  Because I can. How long? 100 days.  Will it be fun? I committing 100 days of my life to it so it had better be!  I started freeCodeCamp today fro mthe very beginning.  It's a lot of material but feels doable; it probably isn't doable in 100 days but I'll get as far as I can.  We all need to change habits sometimes and my habit to change is sticking to it post-college and changing careers because yeah, things are better but not for everyone.  **In all seriousness, I actually did all ofthe HTML & HTML5 sections on freeCodeCamp to get started. W00t!**
